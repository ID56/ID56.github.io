Hi there. I am a first-year CS PhD student at Michigan State University, supervised by Dr. Vishnu Boddeti. Before my PhD, I used to be an AI-Engineer at [Intelligent Machines](https://bangladesh.ai). I obtained my CS Bachelor's degree from the Islamic University of Technology (IUT), in March 2021.

At present, I am working on diffusion models for 3D face reconstruction and diffusion guidance algorithms.

You may reach me at: `morshedm [at] msu [dot] edu`.
