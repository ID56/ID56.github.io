We observe that raw depth-maps possess low contrast in the hand regions of interest (ROI). They do not highlight important fine details, such as finger orientation, overlap between the finger and palm, or overlap between multiple fingers. We thus propose quantizing the depth values into several discrete regions, to create a higher contrast between several key parts of the hand. In addition, we suggest several ways to tackle the high variance problem in existing multimodal fusion CRNN architectures. Our approach shows a significant improvement in accuracy and parameter efficiency over previous similar multimodal methods on the DHG-14/28 dataset and the SHREC'17 track dataset.
