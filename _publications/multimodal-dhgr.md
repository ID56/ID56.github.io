Raw depth-maps possess low contrast in the hand regions of interest (ROI). In order to create a sharp contrast between key parts of the hand and highlight details which are useful to hand gesture recognition, we quantize the depth values into several discrete grayscale regions. Our multimodal CRNN approach shows a significant improvement in accuracy and parameter efficiency over previous similar multimodal methods, on the DHG-14/28 dataset and the SHREC'17 track dataset.
